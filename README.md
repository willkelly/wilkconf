Do you suffer from extreme disorganization?  Do you always wonder
whether you stuck that startup task in bashrc or in profile or in one
of the ten random things you source in your bashrc?

Do you have private data that you want to ship around too all of the workstations you use?  Do you want to use gpg to store all of your passwords?  I do.  

So I started working my way out of this hole.  I am not really
thinking about this problem at all, which means I will very likely
create even bigger problems for myself in attempting to address the
problems I already have.

I would not suggest that anyone else use this.
